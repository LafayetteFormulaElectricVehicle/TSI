Tied +24_RTN & CH_GND
Consider using 2nd DC/DC for 10V, or use DC/DC w/ two outputs (5/12)

Fix footprint outlines for header pins (currently plastic goes outside silkscreen.	

R58 replaced w/ 15kohm (orig. 24.9k). This was due to incorrect gain calculations on isolation circuits.

Drive Button needed a pull-up. Now using Drive Button pin w/ internal pull-up, and a spare/open GND pin.

Tied Pins 19 & 20 together for +24V to Brake Overtravel/Brake Pressed

Replaced R33 w/ 2k resistor to get roughly 17% plausibility window. 
This was for testing purposes and concern over the accuracy of the potentiometers/method of mounting them. 
The 500 ohm resistor in original design is incorrect. This will result in 5% window, not 10%. Needs fixed.

Replaced R25 w/ 4.75k resistor to match APPS2 on car pedal cluster. 
Replaced R26 w/ 4.99k resistor to match APPS1 on car pedal cluster. 
The datasheet for the pots was incorrect, saying 2k, instead of 5k.

One suggestion would be to add trimmer pots as R25, R26, 
that way there may be adjustment depending on the actual potentiometer values. 
Another location a pot may be useful is R33 to the plausibility window may be changed.

Serial Number mask is incorrect. Currently exposes GND plane.
